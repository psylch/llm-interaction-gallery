Features I have implemented:
1. an AI chatbot demo
2. an AI canvas demo
3. an AI version coomand-palette demo
4. an AI chat with artifacts demo
5. an inline-completion demo
6. an AI inline-editing demo

All of them with a runnable demo, a overview text,
and the llm.txt (for user to copy to their coding agent to make a simmilar interaction) 
and exmaple code for that interaction.

Feature I still plan to implement:
None, My project have already been done.

In the future, I may add a comment and uploading feature, for the user to post their own idea or their own AI interaction design on this website.

Issues I have met:
On my website, I wanted users to truly experience the interactive methods I designed for engaging with LLMs. Initially, I planned to embed some free webpages integrated with the Gemini API using iframes, but this approach was blocked by Google's website settings.

As a solution, I ultimately adopted a parallel strategy:
On my own website, users can try out the mock service for each feature. While it doesn’t generate real responses tailored to user inputs, it’s sufficient for demonstrating how this AI interaction works.
For users who want to experience the fully functional AI-powered features, I’ve added direct links to the corresponding free Gemini webpages alongside each feature option.
