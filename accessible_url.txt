Since my project is relatively complex, it uses a framework and has been deployed on a website, with its code open-sourced. 
Simply pasting index.html or app.tsx cannot well demonstrate the functions of my project. 
You can directly visit the project link https://aiux.chihao.li and 
the GitHub link to https://github.com/psylch/llm-interaction-gallery.git view the specific implementation.
